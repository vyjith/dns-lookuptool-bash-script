## Description
-------------------------------------------------- 

I think this script is very useful for the Linux support admin. In this script, you can check A, MX, PTR, WHOIS, and name server information. Another advantage of the script is that you can simply verify the domain registration points they host and so on. I'll share with you a demo of my script below. Please contact me if you encounter any problems running this script.
